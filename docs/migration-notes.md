# Migration notes

Every SQL Server construct in this schema that had no direct Snowflake
equivalent, what it became, and what that costs.

The mechanical conversions (`NVARCHAR` → `VARCHAR`, `GETDATE()` →
`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`, `ISNULL` → `COALESCE`) are enforced by
`snowshift lint` and are not repeated here. This document covers the ones where
a judgement call was made.

---

## Type mappings

| SQL Server | Snowflake | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `NVARCHAR(n)` / `NCHAR(n)` | `VARCHAR(n)` | Snowflake strings are Unicode; length is a soft limit |
| `DATETIME` / `DATETIME2` | `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` | No offset is stored — see *Timezones* below |
| `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER` | `VARCHAR(36)` | Default `UUID_STRING()` |
| `MONEY` / `SMALLMONEY` | `NUMBER(19,4)` | Preserves scale; `MONEY` has 4 decimal places |
| `BIGINT IDENTITY` | `INT AUTOINCREMENT` | Both resolve to `NUMBER(38,0)` |
| `XML` | `VARIANT` | Holds JSON — see *XML to VARIANT* below |
| `HIERARCHYID` | `INT` self-reference | See *Hierarchies* below |
| `ROWVERSION` | `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` | Not a true concurrency token — see *Optimistic concurrency* |
| `VARBINARY(MAX)` / `FILESTREAM` | external stage reference | Binary payloads move to stage storage |

---

## XML to VARIANT

`AllocationRule.TargetSpecification` and `BudgetHeader.BudgetMetadata` were
`XML` columns queried with `.nodes()` and `.value()`.

```sql
-- SQL Server
SELECT t.c.value('@CostCenterID', 'INT')
FROM AllocationRule r
CROSS APPLY r.TargetSpecification.nodes('/Targets/Target') AS t(c);

-- Snowflake
SELECT t.value:CostCenterID::INT
FROM Planning.AllocationRule r,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => r.TargetSpecification:Targets) t;
```

| Changed | Consequence |
|---|---|
| `CROSS APPLY .nodes()` | → `LATERAL FLATTEN()` |
| `.value('@attr', 'TYPE')` | → `:key::TYPE` |
| XQuery predicates | → JSON path syntax |
| Primary XML indexes | Dropped — Snowflake indexes VARIANT sub-columns automatically |

**The cost:** attribute order and XML namespaces are not preserved. Anything
that depended on document order must sort explicitly.

---

## Table-valued parameters

SQL Server TVPs have no Snowflake equivalent at all. Three procedures took them:
`USP_BulkImportBudgetData`, `USP_ExecuteCostAllocation`, and the hierarchy
processing path.

Three options were on the table:

| Option | Chosen | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent staging table | **yes** | Batch-scoped, inspectable after a failure, works from any client |
| `VARIANT` / JSON array argument | partly | Used for `PROCESS_HIERARCHY_JSON`, where payloads are small |
| `COPY INTO` from a stage | no | Adds a file-staging step the callers do not have |

The staging tables live in [`sql/20_staging/`](../sql/20_staging) and each
carries a `StagingBatchID` so concurrent callers do not collide.

**The cost:** the TVP was transaction-scoped and vanished on rollback. A staging
table does not — `CLEANUP_ALLOCATION_RESULTS` exists to sweep abandoned batches,
and it must actually be scheduled.

---

## Computed columns

Snowflake has no persisted computed columns. Four were affected:

| Table | Column | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BudgetHeader` | `IsLocked` | computed from `StatusCode` | regular column, set on write |
| `BudgetLineItem` | — | persisted computed | regular column |
| `ConsolidationJournal` | `IsBalanced` | computed from line sums | regular column |
| `ConsolidationJournalLine` | `NetAmount` | `DebitAmount - CreditAmount` | regular column |

**The cost:** these can now be wrong. In SQL Server the engine guaranteed
`NetAmount = DebitAmount - CreditAmount`; here that is an invariant maintained by
the procedures that write the row. `snowshift parity` compares all three amount
columns on `ConsolidationJournalLine` precisely because a drift between them is
no longer structurally impossible.

---

## Hierarchies

`CostCenter` used `HIERARCHYID` with computed `HierarchyLevel` and `NodePath`
columns.

Replaced with a `ParentCostCenterID` self-reference plus a recursive CTE
(`tvf_ExplodeCostCenterHierarchy`). `HierarchyID` methods — `GetAncestor()`,
`IsDescendantOf()`, `GetLevel()` — become CTE predicates.

**The cost:** `IsDescendantOf()` was an index seek. The recursive CTE is a scan
per level. Fine at this cardinality (hundreds of cost centres); revisit if it
grows by orders of magnitude.

---

## Indexes

Every index in the source was dropped. Snowflake has no user-defined indexes.

| Source construct | Replacement |
|---|---|
| Clustered index | `CLUSTER BY` on the table |
| Nonclustered index | nothing — micro-partition pruning |
| Columnstore index | nothing — storage is already columnar |
| Filtered index | a `WHERE` clause at the query site |
| `INCLUDE` columns | nothing — columnar storage makes this meaningless |
| `IGNORE_DUP_KEY` | removed; duplicates must be handled in the procedure |

`CLUSTER BY` was kept only where the access pattern justified it, e.g.
`FiscalPeriod CLUSTER BY (FiscalYear, FiscalMonth)`. Clustering keys cost
credits to maintain and are not a free substitute for an index.

---

## Views

`SCHEMABINDING` does not exist; Snowflake views track their dependencies
automatically. Indexed views map to `MATERIALIZED VIEW`, though both views here
are left as standard views — materialising them was not justified at this size.

`COUNT_BIG(*)` → `COUNT(*)`, since every Snowflake integer is already 38 digits.

---

## Constraints

Snowflake **declares** `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY` and `UNIQUE` but does not
**enforce** them. Only `NOT NULL` is enforced.

They are kept in the DDL because the query optimiser uses them and because they
document intent — but nothing stops a bad insert. This is the single largest
behavioural difference in the migration: constraint violations that SQL Server
rejected at write time now land silently and surface as a diff in
`snowshift parity`, if at all.

`CHECK` constraints are likewise accepted and not enforced.

---

## Optimistic concurrency

`ROWVERSION` was a monotonic per-database counter that made
`WHERE RowVersion = @expected` a reliable compare-and-swap.

`RowVersionTimestamp TIMESTAMP_NTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` is **not** that.
Two writes inside the same clock tick produce the same value. Any caller relying
on rowversion for optimistic locking needs a real sequence.

---

## Timezones

`TIMESTAMP_NTZ` stores no offset, matching the source `DATETIME2` behaviour. It
is the right mapping for a lift-and-shift, and it means the session timezone
never silently shifts a stored value.

Consequence: `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` returns session-local time, so a procedure run
from a differently configured session writes a differently-meaning value.
`SYSDATE()` (always UTC) is the fix where it matters.

---

## Procedures

All six business procedures became Snowflake Scripting (`LANGUAGE SQL`),
returning `VARIANT` via `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT` rather than output parameters.

| T-SQL | Snowflake Scripting |
|---|---|
| `RAISERROR` / `THROW` | `EXCEPTION` declarations with `RAISE` |
| `@@ROWCOUNT` | `SQLROWCOUNT` |
| `sp_executesql` | `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` |
| `PRINT` | returned in the result `VARIANT` |
| Output parameters | a single `VARIANT` return value |
| `@variable` | `v_variable`, referenced as `:v_variable` |

`MERGE` carried over but is not equivalent: Snowflake raises an error when a
source row matches multiple target rows, where SQL Server picks one
nondeterministically. This is stricter and better, but it will surface latent
duplicate-key bugs on first run. Rule `SS106` flags every `MERGE` for review.

---

## Not migrated

| Construct | Status |
|---|---|
| Triggers | None existed |
| Temporal (system-versioned) tables | Dropped — use Time Travel |
| `ROWGUIDCOL` / merge replication | Dropped |
| SQL Agent jobs | Out of scope — schedule with Snowflake Tasks |
| Linked servers | Out of scope |
